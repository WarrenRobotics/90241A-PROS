# PROS Program for Team 90241A

Welcome! This is the PROS program for the 90241A robotics team. In the future,
you may find some of the code(especially for our menus) to be quite interesting!
For now, this project is currently a work in progress. Our main program uses VEX
Coding Studio at the moment, but we hope to eventually switch to PROS as it
provides more flexibility in certain areas.
